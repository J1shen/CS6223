The scene involving the oak tree and its leaves is described as follows:

"The startling thing is how often the founders themselves don't know. Half the founders I talk to don't know whether they're default alive or default dead."

The oak tree is described as having "golden leaves" that "shimmer like a delicate coin in the dappled sunlight filtering through the branches."
