The description of the scene involving the oak tree and its leaves is:

"The component of entrepreneurship that really matters is domain expertise.  The way to become Larry Page was to become an expert on search. And the way to become an expert on search was to be driven by genuine curiosity, not some ulterior motive.At its best, starting a startup is merely an ulterior motive for curiosity.  And you'll do it best if you introduce the ulterior motive toward the end of the process."

This passage is from the essay "How to Start a Startup" by Sam Altman.
