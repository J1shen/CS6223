The scene is described as follows:

"Of course he wouldn't program in machine language.  That's what compilers are for.  And as for Cobol, he doesn't know how anyone can get anything done with it.  It doesn't even have x (Blub feature of your choice)."

This is a quote from the text, not a scene description.
