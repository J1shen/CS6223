A golden retriever with a glossy coat looks like this while playing in a field of wildflowers on a warm afternoon:

- It is happily leaping through a field of wildflowers.
- Its tail is wagging furiously.
- Butterflies are dancing around it.
- It is full of energy and joy.
- It is enjoying the warmth of the afternoon sun.
