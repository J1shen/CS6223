A golden retriever with a glossy coat looks like a golden retriever, which is a medium to large-sized breed of dog. They have a thick, water-repellent coat that can range in color from light to dark golden. When playing in a field of wildflowers on a warm afternoon, the golden retriever would likely be running around, wagging its tail, and enjoying the sunshine. The glossy coat would reflect the light, giving the dog a healthy, shiny appearance.
