A golden retriever with a glossy coat looks like a golden retriever, which is a medium to large-sized breed of dog. They have a thick, water-repellent coat that can range in color from light to dark golden. When playing in a field of wildflowers on a warm afternoon, the golden retriever would likely be running and jumping around, enjoying the warmth of the sun and the scent of the flowers. The glossy coat would reflect the sunlight, giving the dog a healthy, shiny appearance.
