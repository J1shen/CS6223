A golden retriever with a glossy coat looks like a golden retriever, which is a medium to large-sized breed of dog. They have a thick, water-repellent coat that comes in various shades of gold, from light blonde to dark golden. The coat is dense and wavy, giving it a glossy appearance. When playing in a field of wildflowers on a warm afternoon, the golden retriever would be seen running and jumping around, with its ears flapping and tail wagging. The flowers would be a mix of colors, with the golden retriever's coat contrasting beautifully against the vibrant backdrop.
