A golden retriever with a glossy coat looks like a beautiful, golden-colored dog with a shiny, healthy coat. While playing in a field of wildflowers on a warm afternoon, the dog would likely be running and jumping around, enjoying the warmth of the sun and the scent of the flowers. The golden retriever's coat would glisten in the sunlight, and its eyes would sparkle with excitement as it explores the field.
