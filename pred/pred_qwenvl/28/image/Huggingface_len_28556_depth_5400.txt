A golden retriever with a glossy coat looks like a golden retriever, which is a medium to large-sized breed of dog with a golden or cream-colored coat. The glossy coat suggests that the dog is well-groomed and healthy. In a field of wildflowers on a warm afternoon, the golden retriever would likely be running, playing, and exploring its surroundings. The flowers would provide a colorful and fragrant backdrop to the scene.
