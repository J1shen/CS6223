A golden retriever with a glossy coat looks like a golden retriever, which is a medium to large-sized breed of dog. They have a thick, wavy coat that can be golden, cream, or white in color. The coat is usually long enough to require regular grooming to keep it looking shiny and healthy. In a field of wildflowers on a warm afternoon, the golden retriever would likely be running and playing around, enjoying the sunshine and the scent of the flowers. They are known for their friendly and outgoing personalities, so they would probably be wagging their tail and barking happily as they explored their surroundings.
