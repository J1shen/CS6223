A golden retriever with a glossy coat looks like a golden retriever, which is a medium to large-sized breed of dog. They have a thick, water-repellent coat that is usually golden in color, with a slightly longer, softer undercoat. The coat is dense and shiny, giving the dog a healthy and well-groomed appearance. When playing in a field of wildflowers on a warm afternoon, the golden retriever would likely be running and jumping around, enjoying the sunshine and the scent of the flowers. The dog's coat would shimmer in the sunlight, and its tail would wag excitedly as it played.
