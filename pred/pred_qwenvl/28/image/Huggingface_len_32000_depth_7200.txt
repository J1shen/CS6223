A golden retriever with a glossy coat looks like a beautiful, golden-colored dog with a shiny, healthy coat. While playing in a field of wildflowers on a warm afternoon, it would likely be running around, wagging its tail, and enjoying the sunshine and the scent of the flowers. The golden retriever's coat would glisten in the sunlight, and its eyes would sparkle with excitement and joy.
