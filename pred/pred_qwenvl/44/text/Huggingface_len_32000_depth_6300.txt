According to the passage, the scene described involving a golden retriever and a sun-drenched lake is:

"A golden retriever with a shimmering coat playfully splashes through the crystal-clear water of a sun-drenched lake, sending droplets cascading like diamonds into the air."

This is presented as an example of a scene that is both beautiful and natural, contrasting with the artificial and restrictive nature of big companies.
