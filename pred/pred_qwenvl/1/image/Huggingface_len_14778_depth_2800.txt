A golden retriever with a shiny coat looks like a golden retriever, which is a large, muscular dog with a thick, wavy coat that comes in shades of golden, apricot, and red. While playing in a crystal-clear lake on a warm afternoon, the golden retriever would likely be seen swimming, wading, or playing fetch with a ball or toy. The dog's coat would glisten in the sunlight, and its eyes would sparkle with excitement as it enjoys the refreshing water and warm weather.
