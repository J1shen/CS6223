A golden retriever with a shiny coat looks like a golden retriever, which is a medium to large-sized breed of dog with a golden or cream-colored coat. While playing in a crystal-clear lake on a warm afternoon, the golden retriever would likely be seen running or swimming in the water, with its shiny coat glistening in the sunlight. The dog's tail would be wagging and its ears would be flapping in the breeze. The golden retriever's friendly and energetic nature would be on full display as it enjoys the refreshing lake water and the pleasant weather.
