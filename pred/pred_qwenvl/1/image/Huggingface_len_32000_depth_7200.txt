A golden retriever with a shiny coat looks like a beautiful, golden-colored dog with a lustrous, healthy coat. While playing in a crystal-clear lake on a warm afternoon, it would likely be seen swimming, splashing, or playing with a ball or toy. The dog's coat would glisten in the sunlight, and its eyes would sparkle with excitement and joy. The crystal-clear lake would reflect the dog's golden coat and the surrounding scenery, creating a picturesque and serene scene.
