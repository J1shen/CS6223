A golden retriever with a shiny coat looks like a beautiful, golden-colored dog with a thick, wavy coat that glistens in the sunlight. While playing in a crystal-clear lake on a warm afternoon, the dog would be seen energetically swimming, splashing, and playing with its reflection in the water. Its shiny coat would shimmer and sparkle in the sunlight, creating a stunning visual effect. The dog's movements would be graceful and fluid as it navigates the cool, clear water, and its tail would wag excitedly as it enjoys the refreshing lake. Overall, the scene would be a picturesque and delightful sight to behold
