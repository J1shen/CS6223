A golden retriever with a shiny coat looks like a golden retriever, which is a large, muscular dog with a thick, wavy coat that comes in shades of golden yellow. While playing in a crystal-clear lake on a warm afternoon, the golden retriever would likely be seen running through the shallow water, splashing and playing with itself or with other dogs. Its shiny coat would glisten in the sunlight, and its tail would wag excitedly as it enjoys the refreshing water and the pleasant weather.
