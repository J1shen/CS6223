A golden retriever with a shiny coat looks like a beautiful, golden-colored dog with a thick, wavy coat that glistens in the sunlight. While playing in a crystal-clear lake on a warm afternoon, the dog is likely to be energetically splashing through the water, with its shiny coat reflecting the bright sunlight. The dog's tail may be wagging energetically, and its eyes may be sparkling with excitement. The overall scene is likely to be one of joy and happiness, with the golden retriever enjoying the refreshing water and the warm, sunny day.
