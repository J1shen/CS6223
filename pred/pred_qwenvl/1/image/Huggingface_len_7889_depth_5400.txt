A golden retriever with a shiny coat looks like a golden retriever, which is a large, muscular dog with a thick, wavy coat that comes in shades of gold, from light blonde to dark mahogany. They have a friendly, intelligent expression and a gentle demeanor. When playing in a crystal-clear lake on a warm afternoon, the golden retriever would likely be seen splashing around in the water, with its shiny coat glistening in the sunlight. The dog would be enjoying itself, with its tail wagging and its ears flapping in the breeze.
