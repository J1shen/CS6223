A golden retriever with a shiny coat looks like a beautiful, golden-colored dog with a thick, wavy coat that glistens in the sunlight. While playing in a crystal-clear lake on a warm afternoon, the dog would be seen energetically splashing through the water, its coat shimmering in the sunlight as it moves. The dog's tail would be wagging energetically, and its eyes would be bright and alert as it enjoys the refreshing water and the warm, sunny day.
