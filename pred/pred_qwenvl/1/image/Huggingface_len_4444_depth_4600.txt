A golden retriever with a shiny coat looks like a golden retriever, which is a medium to large-sized dog with a golden or cream-colored coat. They have a muscular build, a broad head, and a friendly, intelligent expression. When playing in a crystal-clear lake on a warm afternoon, the golden retriever would likely be seen running or swimming in the water, with its shiny coat glistening in the sunlight. The dog's tail would be wagging, and its ears would be flopping in the breeze. The golden retriever's playful nature and love for water make it a popular choice for swimming and playing in lakes.
