A golden retriever with a shiny coat looks like a golden retriever, which is a large, muscular dog with a thick, wavy coat that comes in shades of gold, from light blonde to dark mahogany. While playing in a crystal-clear lake on a warm afternoon, the golden retriever would likely be seen running or swimming, with its shiny coat glistening in the sunlight and its tail wagging with excitement. The crystal-clear lake would reflect the golden retriever's coat and the surrounding scenery, creating a beautiful and serene scene.
