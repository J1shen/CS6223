A golden retriever with a shiny coat looks like a golden retriever, which is a large, muscular dog with a thick, wavy coat that comes in shades of gold, from light blonde to dark mahogany. While playing in a crystal-clear lake on a warm afternoon, the golden retriever would likely be seen splashing around in the water, with its shiny coat glistening in the sunlight. The dog's tail would be wagging, and its ears would be flopping as it enjoys the refreshing water.
