A golden retriever with a shiny coat looks like a golden retriever, which is a large, muscular dog with a thick, wavy coat that comes in shades of gold, from light blonde to dark mahogany. They have a friendly, intelligent expression and a gentle, affectionate demeanor. When playing in a crystal-clear lake on a warm afternoon, the golden retriever would likely be seen swimming, fetching, or playing with a ball or toy. The water would sparkle in the sunlight, and the dog would be enjoying itself, wagging its tail and splashing around.
