A golden retriever with a shiny coat looks like a beautiful, golden-colored dog with a thick, wavy coat that glistens in the sunlight. While playing in a crystal-clear lake on a warm afternoon, the dog would be seen splashing and swimming around, with its shiny coat reflecting the bright sunlight. The dog's fur would appear soft and smooth to the touch, and its eyes would sparkle with excitement as it plays and explores the lake. Overall, the dog would look like a happy, healthy, and energetic companion enjoying a beautiful day by the water.
