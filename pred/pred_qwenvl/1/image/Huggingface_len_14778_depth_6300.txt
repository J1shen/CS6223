A golden retriever with a shiny coat looks like a beautiful, golden-colored dog with a thick, wavy coat that glistens in the sunlight. While playing in a crystal-clear lake on a warm afternoon, the dog is likely to be energetically swimming, splashing, and playing with its tail up in the air. The water is clear and sparkling, reflecting the dog's golden coat and the surrounding scenery. The dog's fur is shiny and healthy, and it appears to be enjoying itself as it plays and swims in the refreshing lake water.
