A golden retriever with a shiny coat playing in a crystal-clear lake on a warm afternoon would likely look like a beautiful, golden-colored dog with a thick, wavy coat that glistens in the sunlight. The dog would be running or swimming energetically in the clear, blue water, with its tail wagging and its ears flapping in the breeze. The dog's coat would shimmer and sparkle in the sunlight, reflecting the surrounding scenery and creating a stunning visual effect. The dog would appear happy and content, enjoying the warmth of the sun and the refreshing coolness of the water.
