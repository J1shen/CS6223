A golden retriever with a shiny coat looks like a golden retriever, which is a medium to large-sized breed of dog with a golden or cream-colored coat. While playing in a crystal-clear lake on a warm afternoon, the golden retriever would likely be seen swimming, wading, or playing fetch with a ball or toy. The crystal-clear lake would allow for a clear view of the golden retriever's shiny coat as it moves through the water. The warm afternoon would provide a pleasant environment for the golden retriever to enjoy its playtime in the lake.
