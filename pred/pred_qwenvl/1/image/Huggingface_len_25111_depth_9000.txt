A golden retriever with a shiny coat looks like a golden retriever, which is a medium to large-sized breed of dog with a golden or cream-colored coat. While playing in a crystal-clear lake on a warm afternoon, the golden retriever would likely be seen swimming, wading, or playing fetch with a ball or toy. The crystal-clear lake would reflect the golden retriever's shiny coat, creating a beautiful and serene scene.
