A golden retriever with a shiny coat looks like a beautiful, golden-colored dog with a thick, wavy coat that glistens in the sunlight. While playing in a crystal-clear lake on a warm afternoon, the dog would be seen splashing and swimming around, with its shiny coat reflecting the bright, clear water. The dog's golden fur would shimmer and sparkle in the sunlight, creating a stunning and captivating sight.
