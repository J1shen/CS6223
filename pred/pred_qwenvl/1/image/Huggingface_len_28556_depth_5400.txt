A golden retriever with a shiny coat looks like a golden retriever, which is a large, muscular dog with a thick, wavy coat that comes in shades of golden yellow. While playing in a crystal-clear lake on a warm afternoon, the golden retriever would likely be seen swimming, wading, or playing fetch with a ball or toy. The crystal-clear lake would reflect the golden retriever's shiny coat, creating a beautiful and serene scene. The warm afternoon would provide a comfortable temperature for the golden retriever to enjoy its playtime in the water.
