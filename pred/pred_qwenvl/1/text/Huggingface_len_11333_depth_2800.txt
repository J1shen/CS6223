A golden retriever with a shiny coat looks like this while playing in a crystal-clear lake on a warm afternoon:

- It is a large, muscular dog with a thick, golden coat that glistens in the sunlight.
- Its coat is shiny and well-groomed, reflecting the bright sunlight.
- The dog is playing energetically in the crystal-clear lake, splashing water around and creating a sparkling effect in the sunlight.
- The lake is clear and still, with no waves or ripples, allowing the dog's movements to be clearly visible.
- The dog's tail is wagging energetically as it plays,
