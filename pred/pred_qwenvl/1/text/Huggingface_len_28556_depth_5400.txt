A golden retriever with a shiny coat looks like this while playing in a crystal-clear lake on a warm afternoon:

- It is a golden retriever, which means it has a golden-brown coat.
- The coat is shiny, indicating it is well-groomed and healthy.
- It is playing in a crystal-clear lake, so the water is very clear and you can see the bottom.
- It is on a warm afternoon, so the temperature is comfortable and pleasant.
- The golden retriever is splashing around in the water, sending droplets of water glimmering like diamonds into the warm afternoon sun.
