The scene described involves a silver-haired woman in a flowing blue dress sitting on a weathered park bench. She is gazing thoughtfully at a blooming cherry blossom tree overhead. The screen is too shiny and the disk is surprisingly loud, but the woman finds the iMac beautiful despite these flaws. She feels like she's buying something made in a country with a bad human rights record, which is a new feeling for her.
