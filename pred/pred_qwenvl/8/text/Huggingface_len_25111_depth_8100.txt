In the document, it says:

"A golden retriever leaps joyfully through a field of vibrant wildflowers, its fur glistening under the warm afternoon sun while a gentle breeze carries the sweet scent of blooming lavender."

So a golden retriever in a field of vibrant wildflowers on a warm afternoon does:

1. Leaps joyfully
2. Its fur glistens under the warm afternoon sun
3. A gentle breeze carries the sweet scent of blooming lavender
