The butterfly described in the text is a Monarch butterfly, which is flitting gracefully among purple blooms. Its appearance is compared to sunlight, with the text stating:

"The Monarch butterfly flits gracefully among purple blooms, its wings a brilliant orange, with black and white spots, catching the sunlight as it flutters."
