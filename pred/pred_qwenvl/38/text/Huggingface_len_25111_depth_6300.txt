The scene at the edge of a sun-drenched meadow is described as follows:

"The majestic oak tree(150,25),(590,995) standing proudly at the edge of a sun-drenched meadow, its gnarled branches reaching out like the welcoming arms of an old friend, adorned with vibrant green leaves that flutter gently in the warm breeze."

This creates an image of a large, old oak tree with gnarled branches and green leaves, standing at the edge of a bright, sunlit meadow.
