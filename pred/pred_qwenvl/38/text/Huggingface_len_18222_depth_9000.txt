The scene at the edge of a sun-drenched meadow is described as follows:

"There may be no one who has more experience at trying to predict that, so I can tell you how much an expert can know about it, and the answer is: not much.  I learned to keep a completely open mind about which of the startups in each batch would turn out to be the stars."

The majestic oak tree is described as standing proudly at the edge of the sun-drenched meadow, with gnarled branches reaching out like welcoming arms and adorned with vibrant green leaves that flutter gently in the warm breeze.
