The scene at the edge of a sun-drenched meadow is described as follows:

- There is a majestic oak tree standing proudly at the edge of the meadow.
- The tree has gnarled branches that reach out like the welcoming arms of an old friend.
- The branches are adorned with vibrant green leaves that flutter gently in the warm breeze.
