The scene at the edge of a sun-drenched meadow is described as follows:

"It's really true.
Batch after batch, the YC partners warn founders about mistakes
they're about to make, and the founders ignore them, and then come
back a year later and say "I wish we'd listened."

There is a majestic oak tree standing proudly at the edge of a sun-drenched meadow, its gnarled branches reaching out like the welcoming arms of an old friend, adorned with vibrant green leaves that flutter gently in the warm breeze."
