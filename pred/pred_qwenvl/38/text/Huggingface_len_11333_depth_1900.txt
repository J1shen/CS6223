The scene at the edge of a sun-drenched meadow is described as follows:

"It's probably not that dangerous to start worrying too early that you're default dead, whereas it's very dangerous to start worrying too late."

The majestic oak tree is standing proudly at the edge of the sun-drenched meadow, its gnarled branches reaching out like the welcoming arms of an old friend, adorned with vibrant green leaves that flutter gently in the warm breeze.
