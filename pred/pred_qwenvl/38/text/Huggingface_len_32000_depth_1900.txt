The scene at the edge of a sun-drenched meadow is described as follows:

"It would have to be a majestic oak tree standing proudly at the edge of a sun-drenched meadow, its gnarled branches reaching out like the welcoming arms of an old friend, adorned with vibrant green leaves that flutter gently in the warm breeze."
