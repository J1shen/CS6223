The scene at the edge of a sun-drenched meadow is described as follows:

"An old oak tree stood in the middle of a sun-drenched meadow, casting a shadow over the grass beneath its branches. The meadow was lush and green, with wildflowers blooming in every color of the rainbow. The air was warm and humid, and the sound of birds singing filled the air. The sun was high in the sky, casting a golden glow over everything."
