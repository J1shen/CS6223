The scene at the edge of a sun-drenched meadow is described as follows:

- A large, old tree with a wide trunk and sprawling branches is situated in the meadow.
- The tree is surrounded by lush green grass.
- The sky above is clear and blue, with a few clouds scattered here and there.
- The sun is shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene.
- The meadow itself is expansive, with rolling hills and a gentle slope leading up to the tree.
- The overall atmosphere is serene and peaceful, with the gentle rustling of the grass and the occasional bird chirping in the background
