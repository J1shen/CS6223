The scene at the edge of a sun-drenched meadow is described as follows:

"An old oak tree stood at the edge of a sun-drenched meadow, its branches reaching out like arms to the sky. The meadow was a lush green carpet, dotted with wildflowers of every color. The sun shone brightly, casting long shadows across the grass. The air was warm and filled with the scent of blooming flowers. The scene was peaceful and serene, a perfect place to escape the hustle and bustle of the world."
