The scene at the edge of a sun-drenched meadow is described as follows:

- A large tree is present, with a wide trunk and spreading branches.
- The tree is surrounded by a grassy field.
- The sky is clear and blue.
- The sun is shining brightly, casting shadows on the ground.
- The overall atmosphere is peaceful and serene.

This creates a picturesque and idyllic setting at the edge of the meadow.
