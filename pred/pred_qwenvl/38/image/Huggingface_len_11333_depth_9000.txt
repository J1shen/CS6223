The scene at the edge of a sun-drenched meadow is described as follows:

- There is a large tree with a thick trunk and wide branches, surrounded by tall grass.
- The tree is casting a shadow on the ground.
- The sky is blue with some clouds, indicating a sunny day.
- The overall atmosphere is peaceful and natural, with the sun shining brightly and casting light on the meadow.

This creates a serene and inviting setting, with the tree providing shade and the grass adding to the lush, green environment.
