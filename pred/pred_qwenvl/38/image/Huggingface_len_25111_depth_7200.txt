The scene at the edge of a sun-drenched meadow is described as a large tree with a thick trunk and branches spreading out in all directions. The tree is surrounded by a grassy field with tall grasses swaying in the breeze. The sky is clear and blue, and the sun is shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene.
