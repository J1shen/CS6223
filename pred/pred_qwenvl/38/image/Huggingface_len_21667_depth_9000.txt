The scene at the edge of a sun-drenched meadow is described as follows:

"An old oak tree stood in the middle of a sun-drenched meadow, its branches reaching out to the sky. The grass was lush and green, and the air was filled with the sweet scent of wildflowers. The sun shone down on the scene, casting a warm glow over everything."
