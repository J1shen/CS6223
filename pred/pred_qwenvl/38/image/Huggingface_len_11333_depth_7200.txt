The scene at the edge of a sun-drenched meadow is described as follows:

- There is a large tree with a thick trunk and wide branches, casting a shadow on the ground.
- The tree is surrounded by tall grass and wildflowers.
- The sky is blue with some clouds, indicating a sunny day.
- The overall atmosphere is peaceful and natural, with the sun shining brightly and casting warm light over the scene.

This creates a serene and inviting setting, with the tree providing a focal point and the surrounding vegetation adding to the beauty of the meadow.
