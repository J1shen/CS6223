The imagery depicted in the description of a spider weaving its web in a tranquil morning setting includes:

- A spider in the center of its web
- Dew drops on the spider web
- Daisies in the foreground
- A spider web stretching between the daisies
- The sun shining in the background
- Dew drops on the spider web and daisies

This creates a serene and picturesque scene of a spider working on its web in the early morning.
