The imagery depicted in the description of a spider weaving its web in a tranquil morning setting includes:

- A spider in the center of its web
- The web stretching between daisies
- Dewdrops on the web
- The sun shining through the web
- The spider and web set against a backdrop of daisies and dewdrops
- The scene being set in the morning

This creates a peaceful and serene image of a spider working on its web in a natural, outdoor setting.
