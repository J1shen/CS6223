The imagery depicted in the description of a spider weaving its web in a tranquil morning setting includes:

- A spider hanging from its web in the center of the image.
- The spider web being intricately woven.
- Dew drops hanging from the web, reflecting the sunlight.
- The spider web being surrounded by daisies.
- The scene taking place in a serene, natural setting with a warm, golden light from the rising sun.

This creates a peaceful, almost idyllic image of a spider going about its morning routine in a beautiful, natural environment.
