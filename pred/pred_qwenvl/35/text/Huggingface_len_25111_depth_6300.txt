The imagery depicted in the description of a spider weaving its web in a tranquil morning setting is:

- A delicate spider spinning its gossamer web between two dew-kissed flowers
- Each thread shimmering like silver in the soft morning sun
- The spider's web being described as a "gossamer web" and "shimmering like silver"
