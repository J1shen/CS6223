The scene depicts an elderly woman interacting with a flock of pigeons in a park. She is feeding the pigeons, which are gathered around her feet, with their iridescent feathers shimmering in hues of blue and green. The woman is sitting on a weathered park bench, her silver hair glinting in the golden sunlight.
