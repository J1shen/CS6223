The scene depicts an elderly woman interacting with a flock of pigeons in a park. She is gently feeding the pigeons, who are gathered around her feet. The pigeons have iridescent feathers in hues of blue and green. The woman is sitting on a weathered park bench, and the sunlight is shining on her silver hair, making it glint. The interaction between the woman and the pigeons appears peaceful and serene.
