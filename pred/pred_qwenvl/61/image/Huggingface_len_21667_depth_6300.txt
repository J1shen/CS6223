In the scene, an elderly woman is sitting on a park bench surrounded by a flock of pigeons. She is feeding the pigeons and appears to be enjoying their company. The pigeons are gathered around her, some perched on her lap and others on the bench. The woman seems to be engaging with the birds, perhaps talking to them or simply observing their behavior. The park setting provides a peaceful and natural environment for this interaction.
