Based on the information provided in the text, a tiny hummingbird looks like this:

- It is shimmering with emerald and sapphire feathers.
- It is hovering gracefully above a cluster of vibrant orange flowers.
- It is delicately sipping nectar.

So in that moment, the hummingbird is hovering in mid-air, surrounded by orange flowers, and it is using its beak to sip nectar from the flowers.
