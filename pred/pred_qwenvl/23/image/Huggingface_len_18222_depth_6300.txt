Based on the image description, the tiny hummingbird has a green and blue body with a white belly. It has a long, thin beak and sharp claws. The bird is hovering above vibrant orange flowers, likely feeding on nectar. The hummingbird's wings are beating rapidly, creating a blur as it hovers. The bird's sharp claws grip the flower stem, allowing it to remain stationary while feeding. The vibrant orange flowers provide a striking contrast to the hummingbird's green and blue body.
