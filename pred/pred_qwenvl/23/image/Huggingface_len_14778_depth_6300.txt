A tiny hummingbird looks like a small, colorful bird with a long, slender beak and short, strong legs. It has a small, rounded body and a pair of wings that are constantly flapping to keep it hovering in place. 

In the moment described, the hummingbird is hovering above vibrant orange flowers, likely feeding on the nectar. It is using its long, slender beak to probe into the flowers and extract the nectar, while its small wings continue to flap rapidly to maintain its hovering position.
