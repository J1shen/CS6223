According to the passage, the cat looks like this:

"A sleek silver cat with emerald eyes(150,10),(550,350) lounges languidly on the sun-drenched window sill, its fur glistening like polished silk against the backdrop of fluttering cherry blossoms outside."

So the cat is sleek and silver with emerald eyes, and it is lounging on a sun-drenched window sill. The scene outside includes fluttering cherry blossoms.
