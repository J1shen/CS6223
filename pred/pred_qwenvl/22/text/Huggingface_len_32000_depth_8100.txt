According to the passage, the cat looks like this:

"It lounges languidly on the sun-drenched window sill, its fur glistening like polished silk against the backdrop of fluttering cherry blossoms outside."

So the cat is lounging on a window sill with the sun shining on it, its fur shining like polished silk, and there are fluttering cherry blossoms outside.
