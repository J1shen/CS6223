According to the passage, the cat looks like this:

"A sleek silver cat with emerald eyes(150,10),(550,350) lounges languidly on the sun-drenched window sill, its fur glistening like polished silk against the backdrop of fluttering cherry blossoms outside."

So the cat is sleek silver with emerald eyes, lounging on a sun-drenched window sill. The scene outside includes fluttering cherry blossoms.
