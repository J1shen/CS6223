The scene describes a tabby cat with striking green eyes lounging lazily atop a sun-warmed stone wall. The cat's fur is shimmering like golden silk in the afternoon light. The surroundings include the cat being in the wild, observing animals in their natural habitat, and the cat being a part of a larger predator group. The scene contrasts the cat's natural, wild existence with the more structured, artificial environments humans create.
