A vivid description of a golden retriever playing in a park is:

A golden retriever(279,135),(703,861) is running through a park, splashing through puddles and creating a splash as it goes. The dog's fur is glistening in the sunlight, and its tail is wagging excitedly. It's leaping over rocks and sticks, and its ears are flapping in the wind. The dog's eyes are bright and alert, and it's clearly having a blast.
