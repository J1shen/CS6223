A vivid description of a golden retriever playing in a park is:

A golden retriever, with its golden fur gleaming in the sunlight, is seen running through a park with a joyful expression on its face. Its tail is wagging energetically as it moves, and its ears flap in the wind. The dog is leaping over puddles and dodging the legs of people walking by, its eyes sparkling with excitement. The sound of its panting fills the air as it continues its playful romp, its tail never stopping its wagging.
