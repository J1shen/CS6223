A vivid description of a golden retriever playing in a park is:

A golden retriever(279,135),(689,861), with its golden fur gleaming in the sunlight, is seen energetically running through a park. Its tail wags excitedly as it dashes across the grass, leaping over fallen leaves and bounding over puddles. The dog's eyes sparkle with joy and its ears flap freely in the breeze. As it reaches the edge of the park, it turns and heads back, its tail still wagging and its excitement undiminished.
