A vivid description of a golden retriever playing in a park is:

A golden retriever, with its golden fur shining in the sunlight, is seen running through a park. The dog's tail is wagging excitedly as it moves, and its ears flap in the wind. The dog is leaping and bounding through puddles, creating splashes of water around it. Its eyes are bright and full of joy as it plays, and its tail is wagging so hard that it almost touches the ground. The dog is completely focused on its play, and it seems to be having the time of its life.
