A vivid description of a golden retriever playing in a park is:

A golden retriever, with its golden fur shining in the sunlight, is seen running through a park with joy. Its tail is wagging excitedly as it moves, and its ears flap in the wind. The dog is leaping over puddles and splashing in the water, its eyes sparkling with delight. It is playing with a ball, chasing it and bringing it back with a happy bark. The park is filled with the sound of the dog's playful energy, and the trees rustle in the background.
