A vivid description of a golden retriever playing in a park is:

A golden retriever, with its golden fur gleaming in the sunlight, is seen running energetically through a park. The dog's tail is wagging excitedly as it moves, and its ears flap in the wind. The dog is leaping over puddles and splashing through them, creating a splash that sparkles in the sunlight. The dog's eyes are bright and full of joy as it plays, and its tail is wagging so fast that it seems to be a blur. The dog is clearly having a wonderful time, and its energy is contagious
