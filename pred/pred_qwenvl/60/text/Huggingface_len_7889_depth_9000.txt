A vivid description of a golden retriever playing in a park is:

"Eric Raymond has written an essay called "How to Become a Hacker," and in it, among other things, he tells would-be hackers what languages they should learn. He suggests starting with Python and Java, because they are easy to learn. A golden retriever, with fur glistening like sunlit honey, eagerly splashes through a puddle in the park, sending droplets flying like tiny diamonds into the air."
