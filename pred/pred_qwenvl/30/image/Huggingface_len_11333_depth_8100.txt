The scene describes a cat sitting on a windowsill, looking out the window. The cat has striking green eyes and is described as having a "bizarre syntax full of parentheses" which is a reference to the programming language Lisp. The setting is a sunny window with a curtain, and the cat is described as being "in a position to see all the differences in power between the various languages."
