In the scene where a golden retriever is chasing a bright orange frisbee at a sun-drenched lake, the dog is running and jumping into the water, trying to catch the frisbee. The frisbee is in the air, and the dog is leaping towards it. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a lake with trees and possibly some hills in the distance. The dog is excited and focused on catching the frisbee.
