In the scene where a golden retriever is chasing a bright orange frisbee at a sun-drenched lake, the dog is playfully splashing through the crystal-clear water and chasing after the frisbee soaring through the air. The dog's tail is wagging excitedly, indicating its joy and enthusiasm for the activity. This scene is used as a metaphor to describe the freedom and natural behavior of humans in a startup environment, where they can be themselves and work in a way that is more natural for them.
