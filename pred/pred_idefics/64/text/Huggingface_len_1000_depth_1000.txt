In the scene where a golden retriever is chasing a bright orange frisbee at a sun-drenched lake, the dog is playfully splashing through the crystal-clear water and chasing after the frisbee, which is soaring through the air. The dog's tail is wagging excitedly, indicating its joy and enthusiasm for the activity. This scene is used as an analogy to describe the process of technological progress, which is making things do more of what we want.
