In the scene where a golden retriever is chasing a bright orange frisbee at a sun-drenched lake, the dog is playfully splashing through the crystal-clear water and chasing after the frisbee, with its tail wagging excitedly. This scene is used to illustrate the contrast between the two senses of "normal" living, with the dog's carefree and joyful behavior representing a sense of normalcy that is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve in a world that is becoming more addictive.
