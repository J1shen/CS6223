A delicate butterfly with iridescent blue wings, such as the Blue Morpho, is likely to be found in an autumn garden, where it can feed on nectar from flowers. The butterfly's iridescent blue wings are a result of the way the microscopic scales on its wings reflect light, creating a shimmering effect. As it flutters around the garden, the butterfly will be attracted to the vibrant blooms, which provide the necessary nectar for its survival. The butterfly will land on the flowers, extend its proboscis to drink the nectar, and then fly away to find more food sources.
