A delicate butterfly with iridescent blue wings, such as the Blue Morpho, is likely to be found in tropical and subtropical regions. In an autumn garden, it would be a rare sight, as butterflies are generally more active during the warmer months. However, if present, the butterfly would likely be attracted to the nectar of the flowers, which are abundant in an autumn garden. The butterfly would flutter around the flowers, sipping nectar and possibly laying eggs on the plants. The iridescent blue wings of the butterfly would catch the sunlight, creating a beautiful and striking visual effect among the vibrant blooms of the autumn garden
