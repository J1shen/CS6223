The delicate butterfly with iridescent blue wings is likely to be a monarch butterfly, which is known for its distinctive coloration and migratory patterns. In an autumn garden, the butterfly would be attracted to the vibrant blooms of flowers, such as marigolds, zinnias, and asters, which provide nectar for the butterfly to feed on. The butterfly would land on the flowers to drink the nectar, and in the process, it would also help pollinate the plants. The iridescent blue wings of the butterfly would reflect the sunlight, creating a beautiful and striking visual effect among the autumn garden.
