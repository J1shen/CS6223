A delicate butterfly with iridescent blue wings is likely to be sipping nectar from the vibrant blooms of an autumn garden. Butterflies are attracted to flowers that provide a source of food, and they use their long, tube-shaped proboscis to extract nectar from the flowers. The iridescent blue wings of the butterfly may also serve as a visual attractant, helping the butterfly to stand out among the other flowers and potential mates.
