The delicate butterfly with iridescent blue wings is likely to be a monarch butterfly, which is known for its distinctive coloration and migratory patterns. In an autumn garden, the butterfly would be attracted to the vibrant blooms of flowers, such as marigolds, zinnias, and asters, which provide nectar for the butterfly to feed on. The butterfly would land on the flowers to feed and possibly lay eggs, and it would also use the flowers as a resting place to warm up its wings and prepare for its migration to warmer climates.
