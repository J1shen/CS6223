A delicate butterfly with iridescent blue wings is likely to be sipping nectar from the vibrant blooms of an autumn garden. Butterflies are attracted to flowers with nectar, which they use as a source of energy. The iridescent blue wings of the butterfly may also serve as a visual attractant, helping the butterfly to find the flowers.
