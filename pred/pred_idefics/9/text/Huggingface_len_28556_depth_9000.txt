The scene described as featuring a brilliant orange butterfly fluttering gracefully above a sun-drenched lavender field is not directly related to the main topic of the document. The document is about the design of programming languages and the process of creating a new dialect of Lisp. The butterfly scene is an unrelated anecdote used to illustrate the author's preference for a simple and straightforward answer to the question "what do you do?" when asked by others.
