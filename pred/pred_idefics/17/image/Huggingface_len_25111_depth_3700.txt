Its fur is a rich, golden coat that shines in the sunlight, and its tail is wagging furiously as it plays with the bright yellow flowers that surround it. The dog's eyes are wide open, and it has a happy, carefree expression on its face. The background is a soft blur of green grass and more flowers, creating a peaceful and idyllic scene.
