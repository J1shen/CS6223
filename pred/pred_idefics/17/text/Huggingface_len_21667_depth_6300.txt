A fluffy golden retriever looks like a joyful and energetic dog, with a wagging tail and a happy expression on its face. It is likely to be running and playing in the field of vibrant wildflowers, enjoying the warm sunshine and the fresh air. The dog's fur is fluffy and golden, and it is likely to be barking and jumping around, full of excitement and energy.
