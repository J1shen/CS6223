The scene describes a frayed blue kite flying in the autumn breeze. The kite is depicted as being in motion, with its tail trailing behind it. The sky is clear with a few clouds, and the grass below is depicted as dry and brown, suggesting it is autumn. The kite is the main focus of the image, and its motion and the autumn setting create a sense of movement and change.
