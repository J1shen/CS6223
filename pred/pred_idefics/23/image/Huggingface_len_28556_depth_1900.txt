A tiny hummingbird is hovering above vibrant orange flowers. It has a long, slender body with a green back and a white belly. Its wings are beating rapidly, creating a blur of motion as it hovers in place. The hummingbird's long, thin beak is extended towards the flowers, and it is likely sipping nectar from the blossoms.
