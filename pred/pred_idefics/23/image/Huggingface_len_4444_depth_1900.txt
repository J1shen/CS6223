The tiny hummingbird has a long, slender body with a green back and a white belly. Its head is adorned with a black cap and a red patch on its throat. The bird's wings are spread wide, and it is hovering above a cluster of vibrant orange flowers. The hummingbird's long, thin beak is extended, and it appears to be feeding on the nectar from the flowers.
