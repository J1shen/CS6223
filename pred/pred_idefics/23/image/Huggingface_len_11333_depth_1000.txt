The tiny hummingbird has a slender body with a long, pointed beak and iridescent feathers that shimmer in shades of green, blue, and purple. Its wings are fast-moving and beat at a rapid pace, allowing it to hover in mid-air. The hummingbird is perched on a bright orange flower, and it is drinking nectar from the flower's center.
