The tiny hummingbird has iridescent green feathers on its back and wings, with a white patch on its chest and a blue patch on its head. It has a long, thin beak and is perched on an orange flower. The hummingbird is flapping its wings rapidly as it hovers in the air, and its long tongue is extended towards the flower's nectar.
