The tiny hummingbird has a long, slender body with a green back and a white belly. Its wings are long and narrow, and it has a long, thin beak. The hummingbird is hovering above a cluster of vibrant orange flowers, and it is drinking nectar from one of the flowers. Its long beak is inserted into the flower, and it is sucking up the nectar. The hummingbird's wings are beating rapidly as it hovers in place.
