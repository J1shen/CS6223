The tiny hummingbird has iridescent green feathers on its back and chest, with a white belly and a long, thin beak. It has a long, slender body and wings that beat rapidly as it hovers above the vibrant orange flowers. The hummingbird is drinking nectar from the flowers, using its long beak to reach deep into the flower's center.
