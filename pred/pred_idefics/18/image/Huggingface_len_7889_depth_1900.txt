A golden retriever with a shimmering coat is playfully splashing in the crystal-clear waters of a sunlit lake. The dog is mid-action, with its front paws in the water and its tail wagging excitedly. The sunlight reflects off the water, creating a shimmering effect that highlights the dog's fur. The background is blurred, emphasizing the dog as the main subject of the image.
