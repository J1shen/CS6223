A golden retriever with a shimmering coat is playfully splashing in the crystal-clear waters of a sunlit lake. The dog is fully submerged in the water, with its head and front paws above the surface. Its fur is glistening in the sunlight, reflecting the light and giving it a radiant appearance. The water around the dog is calm and still, with only a few ripples caused by the dog's playful movements. The scene is serene and peaceful, with the dog enjoying its time in the water.
