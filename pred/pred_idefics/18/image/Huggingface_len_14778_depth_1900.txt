A golden retriever with a shimmering coat is playfully splashing in the crystal-clear waters of a sunlit lake. The dog is fully submerged in the water, with its head and front paws above the surface. The sunlight reflects off the water, creating a shimmering effect on the dog's coat. The dog appears to be enjoying itself, as it is splashing and playing in the water.
