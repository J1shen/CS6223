A golden retriever with a shimmering coat is playfully splashing in the crystal-clear waters of a sunlit lake. The dog is fully immersed in the water, its fur glistening in the sunlight. The water is so clear that the bottom of the lake is visible, and the sunlight reflects off the surface, creating a shimmering effect. The dog appears to be enjoying itself, as it is splashing and playing in the water.
