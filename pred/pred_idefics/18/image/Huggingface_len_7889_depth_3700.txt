A golden retriever with a shimmering coat is playfully splashing in the crystal-clear waters of a sunlit lake. The dog is fully submerged in the water, with its head and front paws visible above the surface. Its fur is glistening in the sunlight, reflecting the light and giving it a radiant appearance. The water around the dog is calm and undisturbed, with only a few ripples caused by the dog's playful movements. The background of the image is blurred, emphasizing the dog as the main subject.
