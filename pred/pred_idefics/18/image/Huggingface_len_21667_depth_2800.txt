A golden retriever with a shimmering coat is playfully splashing in the crystal-clear waters of a sunlit lake. The dog is fully submerged in the water, its fur glistening in the sunlight. The water is so clear that the dog's reflection can be seen on the surface. The dog's tail is wagging excitedly as it splashes around, creating small waves. The sunlight is reflecting off the water, creating a shimmering effect. The scene is peaceful and serene, with the only sound being the dog's playful splashing.
