A golden retriever with a shimmering coat is playfully splashing in the crystal-clear waters of a sunlit lake. The dog is fully submerged in the water, with its head and front paws above the surface. The water is so clear that the dog's fur and the surrounding environment are visible, creating a vivid and refreshing scene. The sunlight reflects off the water, adding a shimmering effect to the dog's coat and the lake's surface. The dog appears to be enjoying its time in the water, as it is splashing and playing around.
