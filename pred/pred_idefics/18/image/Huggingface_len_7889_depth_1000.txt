A golden retriever with a shimmering coat is playfully splashing in the crystal-clear waters of a sunlit lake. The dog is fully submerged in the water, with its head and front paws above the surface. Its fur is glistening in the sunlight, reflecting the light and giving it a radiant appearance. The water around the dog is calm and clear, with small ripples caused by the dog's movements. The background of the image is blurred, with a few out-of-focus spots of light, possibly from the sun or other sources.
