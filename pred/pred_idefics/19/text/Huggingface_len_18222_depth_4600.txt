The description of a delicate butterfly with iridescent blue wings fluttering gracefully among the vibrant blooms of a sunlit garden is a metaphor used to describe the software developed by Viaweb, a startup founded by Paul Graham and Robert Morris in 1995. The software, which allowed end users to build online stores, was considered a novel idea at the time and was named after it.
