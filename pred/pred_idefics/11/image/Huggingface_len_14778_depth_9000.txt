The vibrant orange butterfly is perched on a purple lavender flower in the late afternoon sunlight. The butterfly's wings are spread wide, and it is basking in the warm sunlight. The lavender flowers are in full bloom, and their purple petals are gently swaying in the breeze. The butterfly's orange color stands out against the purple flowers, creating a striking contrast. The sunlight casts a golden glow on the butterfly and the lavender, making them both appear even more vibrant.
