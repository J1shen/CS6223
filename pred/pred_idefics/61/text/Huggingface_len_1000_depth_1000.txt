In the scene described, an elderly woman sits on a weathered park bench, feeding a flock of pigeons that gather at her feet. The pigeons' iridescent feathers shimmer in hues of blue and green as they interact with the woman. This scene serves as a contrast to the rest of the text, which discusses the increasing addictiveness of various substances and technologies. The image of the elderly woman and the pigeons symbolizes a simpler, more innocent time, where people could enjoy nature and simple pleasures without the influence of addictive substances and technologies.
