In the scene described, an elderly woman is sitting on a weathered park bench, feeding a flock of pigeons that gather at her feet. The pigeons have iridescent feathers shimmering in hues of blue and green. The woman's silver hair glints in the golden sunlight, and she is gently interacting with the pigeons.
