In the scene described, an elderly woman is sitting on a weathered park bench, feeding a flock of pigeons. The pigeons are iridescent, with feathers shimmering in hues of blue and green. The woman's silver hair glints in the golden sunlight, and she appears to be enjoying the interaction with the birds.
