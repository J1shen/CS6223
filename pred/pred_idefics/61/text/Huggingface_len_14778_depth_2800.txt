In the scene described, an elderly woman is sitting on a weathered park bench, feeding a flock of pigeons that gather at her feet. The pigeons have iridescent feathers shimmering in hues of blue and green, and a particularly overreaching pigeon is described as having fussy tastes and a rigidly enforced house style. The woman seems to be enjoying the interaction with the pigeons, and the scene is peaceful and serene.
