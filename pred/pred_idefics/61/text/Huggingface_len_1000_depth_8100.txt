The scene described is of an elderly woman sitting on a weathered park bench, feeding a flock of pigeons that gather at her feet. The pigeons' feathers shimmer in hues of blue and green as they interact with the woman. This scene is used to illustrate the contrast between the "normal" behavior of the elderly woman and the increasingly addictive nature of modern society.
