In the scene described, an elderly woman is sitting on a bench in a park, surrounded by a flock of pigeons. The woman is wearing a green jacket and a red scarf, and she is looking down at the pigeons. The pigeons are perched on the bench and the ground around her, and they seem to be interacting with her. The background of the image is blurred, but it appears to be a park with trees and possibly other people. The woman's expression is not visible, but the pigeons seem to be calm and non-threatening.
