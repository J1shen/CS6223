The image depicts a solitary cat sitting on a window sill, looking out the window. The cat has a brown and black striped coat and is gazing out the window. The window has a white frame and is covered with a glass pane. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a room with a wall and possibly a door. The cat's ears are perked up, and it seems to be observing something outside.
