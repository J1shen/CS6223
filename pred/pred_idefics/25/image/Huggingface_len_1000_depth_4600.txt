The image depicts a solitary cat sitting on a window sill. The cat has a brown and black striped fur pattern and is looking out the window. The window has a glass pane, and the cat is sitting on a white surface, possibly a window ledge or a table. The background shows a blurry view of the outside, possibly a garden or a street. The lighting in the image suggests that it is either early morning or late afternoon, as the sunlight is soft and diffused.
