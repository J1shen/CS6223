In the corner of a sunlit garden, there is a spider web. A spider is sitting in the center of the web, and it is surrounded by the intricate and delicate strands of the web. The spider is likely using the web to catch prey, such as insects, and the web is a crucial part of its survival. The sunlit garden provides a bright and warm environment for the spider to thrive.
