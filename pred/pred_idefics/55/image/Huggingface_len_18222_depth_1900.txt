In the corner of a sunlit garden, there is a spider web. A spider is sitting in the center of the web, which is made up of fine, white threads. The spider is brown and black in color, and it has eight legs. The web is positioned in a way that it is catching the sunlight, which creates a beautiful and serene scene.
