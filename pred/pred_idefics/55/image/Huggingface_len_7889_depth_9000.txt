In the corner of a sunlit garden, there is a spider web. A spider is sitting in the center of the web, and it is surrounded by the web's intricate patterns. The web is glistening in the sunlight, and the spider's body is slightly blurred, indicating that it is in motion. The background of the image is slightly out of focus, with some greenery visible, suggesting that the garden is lush and vibrant.
