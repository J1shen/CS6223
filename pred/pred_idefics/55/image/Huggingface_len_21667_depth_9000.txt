In the corner of a sunlit garden, there is a spider web. A spider is sitting in the center of the web, which is illuminated by the sunlight. The web is intricately designed with delicate lines and patterns. The spider is stationary, possibly waiting for prey or resting. The garden is filled with greenery, and the sunlight creates a warm and inviting atmosphere.
