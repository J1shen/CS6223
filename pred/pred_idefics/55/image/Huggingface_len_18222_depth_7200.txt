In the corner of a sunlit garden, there is a spider web. A spider is sitting in the center of the web, and it is surrounded by the web's intricate structure. The web is made up of thin, delicate threads that are connected to each other, forming a complex pattern. The spider is using its eight legs to move around the web, and it is also using its web to catch prey. The sun is shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene, and the garden is filled with various plants and flowers.
