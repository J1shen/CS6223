The image depicts a tabby cat sitting on a stone surface. The cat has a brown and black striped pattern on its fur, with a white belly. The cat's ears are perked up, and it is looking forward with its green eyes. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a natural setting, possibly a garden or a park.
