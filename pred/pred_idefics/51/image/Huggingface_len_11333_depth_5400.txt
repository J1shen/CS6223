The image depicts a tabby cat sitting on a stone wall. The cat has a striped pattern on its fur, with a mix of brown, black, and white colors. The cat's eyes are green, and it is looking forward. The stone wall is made up of large, rough stones, and the cat is sitting on the top of it. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a natural setting, possibly a garden or a park.
