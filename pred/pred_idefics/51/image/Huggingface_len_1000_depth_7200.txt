The image depicts a tabby cat with a brown and black striped pattern on its fur. The cat is lying on a stone wall, with its front paws resting on the edge of the wall. The background is blurred, but it appears to be an outdoor setting, possibly a garden or a park, with greenery visible. The cat's eyes are wide open, and it is looking directly at the camera.
