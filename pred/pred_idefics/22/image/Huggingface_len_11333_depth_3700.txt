The cat is a gray and white feline with a slender body and long, pointed ears. It has green eyes and a pink nose. The cat is lying down on a wooden window sill, enjoying the warm sunlight. The scene outside the window is blurry, but there are some pink flowers visible, suggesting that it might be spring or early summer.
