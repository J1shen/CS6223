The cat is a gray and white striped feline with green eyes, lying on a wooden window sill. The cat is in a relaxed position, with its front paws resting on the window sill and its head turned slightly to the side. The scene outside the window is blurry, but there are some pink flowers visible, suggesting that it might be spring or early summer.
