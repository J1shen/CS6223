The cat is a gray and white feline with a slender body and long, pointed ears. It has a fluffy tail and is sitting upright, with its front paws resting on the window sill. The cat's fur is slightly ruffled, and it has a curious expression on its face. The window sill is made of wood and is painted white. The scene outside the window is bright and sunny, with a few pink flowers visible in the background. The flowers are small and delicate, with multiple petals and a light pink color.
