The scene described with a golden retriever is a metaphorical representation of the author's experience of buying a new iMac. The author mentions that the iMac is "fabulous" but also has a shiny screen and a loud disk. The author feels a sense of unease and compares it to buying something made in a country with a bad human rights record. The author questions whether they should support the company that made the iMac, Apple, due to their reputation as "assholes."
