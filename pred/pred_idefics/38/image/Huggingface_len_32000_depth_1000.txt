The grass is a vibrant green, and the wildflowers that dot the landscape are in full bloom, adding splashes of color to the scene. The sky above is clear and blue, with a few wisps of clouds drifting lazily by. The air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers and the gentle hum of insects. The meadow is dotted with small rocks and patches of tall grass, providing a natural and unspoiled beauty
