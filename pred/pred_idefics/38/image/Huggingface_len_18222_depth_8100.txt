The scene at the edge of a sun-drenched meadow is a picturesque and serene landscape. The meadow is bathed in warm sunlight, casting a golden glow over the lush green grass. The grass is tall and vibrant, with a few patches of wildflowers adding splashes of color to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few scattered clouds drifting lazily by. In the distance, a few trees can be seen, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. The overall atmosphere is one of peace and tranquility, with the sun's rays creating a sense of warmth and comfort.
