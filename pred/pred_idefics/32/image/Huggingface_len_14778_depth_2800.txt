The image depicts a large oak tree with a thick trunk and branches extending upwards. The tree is covered with yellow leaves, which are scattered on the ground. The leaves are of various sizes and shapes, and they appear to be in the process of falling. The ground is covered with a layer of fallen leaves, and there is a sense of autumn in the scene. The sky is not visible in the image, but the lighting suggests it might be daytime.
