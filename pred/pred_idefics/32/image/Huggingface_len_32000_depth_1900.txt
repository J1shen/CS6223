The scene involves an oak tree with yellow leaves. The tree has a large, sturdy trunk with branches extending upwards and outwards. The leaves are scattered on the ground, creating a carpet of yellow. The sunlight filters through the leaves, casting a warm glow on the ground. The tree stands tall and proud, its leaves rustling gently in the breeze.
