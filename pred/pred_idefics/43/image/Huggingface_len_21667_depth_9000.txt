The scene describes a stray orange cat sitting on a window ledge, looking out the window. The cat is in a sunny spot, and the sunlight is creating a warm glow around it. The cat is sitting calmly, with its front paws resting on the window ledge and its tail curled around its body. The window has a white frame and a lock, and the view outside the window is slightly blurred, but it appears to be a street with some trees and cars.
