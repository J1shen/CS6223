The scene describes a stray orange cat sitting on a window sill, looking out the window. The cat is in a relaxed position, with its front paws resting on the window sill and its head turned slightly to the side. The cat is in a sunny spot, and the sunlight is creating a warm glow around it. The window is open, and the cat is looking outside, possibly watching the street or the sky.
