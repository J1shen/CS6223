The scene describes a stray orange cat sitting on a window ledge, looking out the window. The cat is in a relaxed position, with its front paws resting on the window ledge and its head turned slightly to the side. The cat is in a sunny spot, and the sunlight is creating a warm glow around it. The window has a white frame and a white latch, and the view outside the window is blurred, but it appears to be a street with cars and trees.
