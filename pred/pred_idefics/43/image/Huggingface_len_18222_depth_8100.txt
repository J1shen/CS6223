The scene describes a stray orange cat sitting on a window ledge, looking out the window. The cat is in a relaxed position, with its front paws resting on the window ledge and its back legs stretched out behind it. The cat is in a sunny spot, and the sunlight is creating a warm glow around it. The window has a white frame and a lock on the inside. The background outside the window is blurry, but it appears to be a street with cars and trees.
