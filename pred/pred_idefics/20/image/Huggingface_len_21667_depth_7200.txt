The scene depicts a sunflower in full bloom, with its bright yellow petals and dark brown center. The sunflower is swaying gently in the afternoon breeze, which is carrying the sweet scent of the flower. Bees are buzzing around the sunflower, collecting nectar from its pollen-rich anthers. The sunflower's tall stem is supporting its large, broad head, and its leaves are spread out to catch the sunlight. The background is blurred, focusing attention on the sunflower and the bees.
