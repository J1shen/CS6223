The scene depicts a sunflower with a bright yellow flower head, surrounded by green leaves. The sunflower is in full bloom, and the afternoon breeze is gently blowing, causing the petals to move slightly. There are three bees on the sunflower, each with a different position and orientation. The bees are collecting nectar from the sunflower, and their presence indicates that the sunflower is in full bloom and ready for pollination.
