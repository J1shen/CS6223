The scene depicts a sunflower with a bright yellow flower head, surrounded by green leaves. The sunflower is in full bloom, and the afternoon breeze is gently blowing, causing the petals to sway slightly. Bees are present on the sunflower, collecting nectar from the flower's pollen. The sunflower is in a field, with other sunflowers in the background, all facing towards the sun. The sky is clear, and the sun is shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene.
