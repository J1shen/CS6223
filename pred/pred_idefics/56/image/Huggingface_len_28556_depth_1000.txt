A delicate butterfly with iridescent blue wings is likely to be seen fluttering around a patch of vibrant orange marigolds in a sunlit garden, feeding on the nectar of the flowers. Butterflies are attracted to bright colors and sweet fragrances, and marigolds are known for their bright orange petals and strong scent. The butterfly's iridescent blue wings reflect the sunlight, creating a beautiful contrast with the orange marigolds.
