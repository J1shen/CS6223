A delicate butterfly with iridescent blue wings is likely to be seen fluttering above a patch of vibrant orange marigolds in a sunlit garden. The butterfly is attracted to the marigolds due to their bright color and the nectar they provide. The butterfly's iridescent blue wings reflect the sunlight, creating a beautiful and striking contrast with the orange marigolds. As the butterfly flutters above the marigolds, it may be collecting nectar from the flowers or simply enjoying the warmth and light of the sun.
