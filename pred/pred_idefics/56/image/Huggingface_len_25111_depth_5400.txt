A delicate butterfly with iridescent blue wings is likely to be seen fluttering above a patch of vibrant orange marigolds in a sunlit garden, as it is attracted to the nectar of the flowers. The butterfly's iridescent blue wings reflect the sunlight, creating a beautiful and striking visual effect. The marigolds, with their bright orange petals, provide a stark contrast to the butterfly's blue wings, making the scene even more visually appealing. The butterfly's presence above the marigolds suggests that it is feeding on the nectar of the flowers, which is a common behavior for butterflies.
