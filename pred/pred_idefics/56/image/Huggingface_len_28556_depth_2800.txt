A delicate butterfly with iridescent blue wings is likely to be attracted to the vibrant orange marigolds in a sunlit garden. Butterflies are known to be drawn to bright colors, especially orange and yellow, as these colors are often associated with nectar-rich flowers. The butterfly may land on the marigolds to feed on the nectar, which is a source of energy for them. The sunlit garden provides the perfect environment for the butterfly to fly and search for food, as the warmth and light can help to activate its wings and enhance its ability to fly.
