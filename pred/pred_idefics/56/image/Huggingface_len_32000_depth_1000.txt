A delicate butterfly with iridescent blue wings is likely to be attracted to the vibrant orange marigolds in a sunlit garden. Butterflies are known to be drawn to bright and colorful flowers, as they serve as a source of nectar for them. The iridescent blue wings of the butterfly may also help it to blend in with the blue sky, making it easier for it to fly and find more flowers. As the butterfly flutters above the patch of marigolds, it may also be using its proboscis to drink the nectar from the flowers, which is essential for its survival.
