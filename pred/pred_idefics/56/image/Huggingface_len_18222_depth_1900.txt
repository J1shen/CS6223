A delicate butterfly with iridescent blue wings is perched on a patch of vibrant orange marigolds in a sunlit garden. The butterfly is likely feeding on the nectar of the marigolds, as butterflies are known to be attracted to the sweet, fragrant flowers. The iridescent blue wings of the butterfly reflect the sunlight, creating a beautiful and striking contrast with the bright orange marigolds. The butterfly's delicate nature and the vibrant colors of the marigolds create a picturesque scene in the sunlit garden.
