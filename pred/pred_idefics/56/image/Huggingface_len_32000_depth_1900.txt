A delicate butterfly with iridescent blue wings is likely to be seen fluttering around a patch of vibrant orange marigolds in a sunlit garden. The butterfly is attracted to the nectar of the marigolds, which is a source of energy for the butterfly. As it flutters around the marigolds, the butterfly's iridescent blue wings will reflect the sunlight, creating a beautiful and striking visual effect. The butterfly may also be using the marigolds as a place to rest and hide from predators.
