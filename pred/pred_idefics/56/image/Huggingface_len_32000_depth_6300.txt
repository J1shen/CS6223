A delicate butterfly with iridescent blue wings is likely to be seen fluttering above a patch of vibrant orange marigolds in a sunlit garden. The butterfly is attracted to the nectar of the marigolds, which are rich in nutrients and provide a source of energy for the butterfly. As the butterfly flutters above the marigolds, it will be able to feed on the nectar and bask in the warmth of the sun, which is essential for its survival. The iridescent blue wings of the butterfly will also reflect the sunlight, creating a beautiful and striking visual effect in the garden.
