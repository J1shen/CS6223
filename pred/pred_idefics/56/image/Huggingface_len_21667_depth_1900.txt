A delicate butterfly with iridescent blue wings is likely to be seen fluttering above a patch of vibrant orange marigolds in a sunlit garden. The butterfly is attracted to the nectar of the marigolds, which are rich in nutrients and provide a source of energy for the butterfly. As the butterfly flutters above the marigolds, it will use its proboscis to extract the nectar from the flowers. The iridescent blue wings of the butterfly will reflect the sunlight, creating a beautiful and striking visual effect.
