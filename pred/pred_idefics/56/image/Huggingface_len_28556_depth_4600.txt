A delicate butterfly with iridescent blue wings is likely to be seen fluttering above a patch of vibrant orange marigolds in a sunlit garden, as it is attracted to the nectar of the flowers. The butterfly's iridescent blue wings reflect the sunlight, creating a beautiful and striking visual effect. The marigolds, with their bright orange petals, provide a stark contrast to the butterfly's delicate wings, making the scene even more picturesque.
