A delicate butterfly with iridescent blue wings is likely to be seen fluttering around a patch of vibrant orange marigolds in a sunlit garden, feeding on the nectar of the flowers. Butterflies are attracted to bright colors and sweet fragrances, and marigolds are known for their bright orange petals and strong scent. As the butterfly flutters around the marigolds, it will use its long proboscis to extract the nectar from the flowers, which will provide it with the energy it needs to fly and reproduce.
