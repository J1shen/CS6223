A delicate butterfly with iridescent blue wings is likely to be attracted to the vibrant orange marigolds in a sunlit garden. Butterflies are known to be drawn to bright and colorful flowers, as they serve as a source of nectar for them. The iridescent blue wings of the butterfly may also help it to blend in with the blue sky, making it easier for it to fly and find more flowers. As the butterfly flutters above the patch of marigolds, it may also be collecting pollen and transferring it to other flowers, playing a crucial role in the pollination process.
