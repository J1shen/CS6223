A delicate butterfly with iridescent blue wings is likely to be resting or feeding on the nectar of the vibrant orange marigolds in a sunlit garden. Butterflies are attracted to flowers with nectar, which they use as a source of energy. The iridescent blue wings of the butterfly may also serve as a visual attractant to other butterflies or as a warning signal to potential predators.
