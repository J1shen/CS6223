The delicate butterfly with iridescent blue wings is likely to be sipping nectar from the vibrant orange marigolds in the sunlit garden. Butterflies are attracted to flowers with nectar, which is a source of energy for them. The iridescent blue wings of the butterfly are a result of the way the microscopic scales on its wings reflect light, giving it a shimmering appearance. The butterfly's wings are also covered with tiny hairs that help it to sense its environment and navigate.
