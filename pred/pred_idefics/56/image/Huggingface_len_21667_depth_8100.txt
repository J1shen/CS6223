The delicate butterfly with iridescent blue wings is perched on a patch of vibrant orange marigolds in a sunlit garden. It is likely sipping nectar from the flowers or basking in the warmth of the sunlight. The butterfly's iridescent blue wings reflect the light, creating a beautiful and striking visual effect. The marigolds, with their bright orange petals, provide a stark contrast to the butterfly's blue wings, making the scene even more visually appealing.
