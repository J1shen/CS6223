The delicate butterfly with iridescent blue wings is perched on a patch of vibrant orange marigolds in a sunlit garden. The butterfly is likely sipping nectar from the marigolds, as butterflies are known to be attracted to the sweet, fragrant flowers. The iridescent blue wings of the butterfly reflect the sunlight, creating a beautiful and striking contrast with the bright orange marigolds. The sunlit garden provides a warm and inviting environment for the butterfly to feed and bask in the sunlight.
