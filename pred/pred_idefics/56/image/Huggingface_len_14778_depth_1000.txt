The delicate butterfly with iridescent blue wings is perched on a patch of vibrant orange marigolds in a sunlit garden. The butterfly is likely sipping nectar from the marigolds, as butterflies are known to feed on the sweet, energy-rich liquid found in flowers. The iridescent blue wings of the butterfly reflect the sunlight, creating a beautiful and striking contrast with the bright orange marigolds. The sunlit garden provides a warm and inviting environment for the butterfly to rest and feed, and the marigolds offer a source of sustenance and beauty in the garden.
