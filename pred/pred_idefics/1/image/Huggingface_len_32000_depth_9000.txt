A golden retriever with a shiny coat playing in a crystal-clear lake on a warm afternoon would look like a happy and energetic dog, with its fur glistening in the sunlight. The dog would be splashing and frolicking in the water, creating small waves and ripples. The lake would reflect the dog's golden coat, making it appear even more vibrant and shiny. The overall scene would be filled with the joy and excitement of the dog playing in the water.
