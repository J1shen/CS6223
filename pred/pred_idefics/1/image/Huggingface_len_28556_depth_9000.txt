The golden retriever with a shiny coat looks like it is having a lot of fun while playing in the crystal-clear lake on a warm afternoon. The dog is splashing around in the water, and its fur is glistening in the sunlight. The lake is so clear that you can see the reflection of the dog and the sky in it. The dog's tail is wagging excitedly as it plays in the water.
