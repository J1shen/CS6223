A golden retriever with a shiny coat looks like a joyful and happy dog, splashing in the crystal-clear lake on a warm afternoon. The dog's shiny coat glistens in the sunlight, and the water droplets around it sparkle like diamonds. The dog's tail is wagging, and it is having a great time playing in the water.
