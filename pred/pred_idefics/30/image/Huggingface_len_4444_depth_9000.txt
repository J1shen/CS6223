The image depicts a cat sitting on a window sill. The cat has a striped pattern on its fur, with a mix of brown and black colors. Its ears are large and pointed, and it has green eyes. The cat is looking out the window, which is open, allowing natural light to enter the room. The window has a white frame and a white curtain on the left side. The window sill is also white and has a radiator underneath it. The background outside the window is slightly blurred, but it appears to be a sunny day with some trees visible.
