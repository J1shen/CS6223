The scene describes a cat sitting on a windowsill, looking out the window. The cat has a striped pattern on its fur and is positioned in a way that suggests it is observing something outside. The window has a white curtain, and the cat's eyes are wide open, indicating that it is alert and possibly curious about what it sees outside.
