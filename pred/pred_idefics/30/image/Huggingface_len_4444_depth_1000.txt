The image depicts a cat sitting on a window sill. The cat is brown and white, with a striped pattern on its body. The cat is looking out the window, which is open, and there is a curtain on the left side of the window. The window has a white frame, and the window sill is also white. The background outside the window is blurry, but it appears to be a natural setting, possibly a garden or a park.
