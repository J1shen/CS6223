The scene describes a cat sitting on a window sill, looking out the window. The cat has a striped pattern on its fur and is positioned in a way that suggests it is observing the outside view. The window has a white curtain, and the cat's ears are perked up, indicating that it is alert and possibly curious about what it sees outside.
