The scene describes a cat sitting on a windowsill, looking out the window. The cat has a striped pattern on its fur and is positioned in a way that suggests it is observing something outside. The window has a white curtain, and the cat's presence on the windowsill adds a sense of curiosity and alertness to the scene.
