The scene describes a cat lounging lazily on a sun-drenched windowsill. The cat has slender legs, emerald eyes, and a shiny, silver fur that reflects the late afternoon light filtering through sheer curtains. The cat appears to be an overreaching one with fussy tastes and a rigidly enforced house style.
