A golden retriever is running in a park, its fur glistening in the sunlight as it plays with a ball. The dog's tail is wagging excitedly, and its ears are flapping in the wind. The dog is jumping and leaping, its paws barely touching the ground as it chases after the ball. The park is filled with trees and green grass, and the dog is surrounded by the sounds of nature.
