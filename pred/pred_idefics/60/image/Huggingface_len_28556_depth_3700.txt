A golden retriever is running in a park, its fur glistening in the sunlight as it plays with a ball. The dog's tail is wagging excitedly, and its ears are flapping in the wind. The dog is leaping and bounding across the grass, its paws barely touching the ground. The dog's eyes are shining with joy, and its mouth is open in a happy expression. The dog is surrounded by trees and greenery, and the sky is a clear blue above.
