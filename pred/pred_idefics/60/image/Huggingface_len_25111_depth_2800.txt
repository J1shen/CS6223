A golden retriever is running in a park, its fur glistening in the sunlight as it plays with a ball. The dog's tail is wagging excitedly as it chases after the ball, its ears flapping in the wind. The dog's paws are barely touching the ground as it leaps and bounds, its joyful barks filling the air. The park is filled with green grass and trees, and the dog is surrounded by the sounds of nature.
