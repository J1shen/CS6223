A golden retriever is running in a park, its fur glistening in the sunlight as it splashes through a puddle of water. The dog's tail is wagging excitedly as it chases after a ball, its ears flapping in the wind. The dog's eyes are bright and happy, and it seems to be enjoying the fresh air and the freedom of the park.
