The golden retriever is running through a park, its fur glistening in the sunlight as it splashes through a puddle of water. Its tail is wagging excitedly as it plays, and its ears are flapping in the wind. The dog's eyes are bright and happy, and it seems to be enjoying the fresh air and the freedom of being outside.
