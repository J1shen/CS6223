A golden retriever is running in a park, its fur glistening in the sunlight as it plays with a ball. The dog's tail is wagging excitedly, and its ears are flapping in the wind. The dog is leaping over a small obstacle, its paws barely touching the ground. The park is filled with green grass and trees, and the dog is surrounded by the sounds of children playing and birds chirping.
