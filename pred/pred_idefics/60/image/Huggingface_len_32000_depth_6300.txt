A golden retriever is running in a park, its fur glistening in the sunlight as it plays with a ball. The dog's tail is wagging excitedly, and its ears are flapping in the wind. The dog is leaping and bounding across the grass, its paws barely touching the ground. The park is filled with trees and greenery, and the dog is surrounded by the sounds of nature.
