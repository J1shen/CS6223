The document describes a scene where a tabby cat is sitting on a wooden surface, possibly a table or a counter, and is looking out the window. The cat is described as having a shiny coat and is sitting in a relaxed position. The window has a greenish tint, and the outside view is blurred, but it appears to be a natural setting, possibly a garden or a park.
