A golden retriever with a glossy coat while playing in a field of wildflowers on a warm afternoon would likely have a shiny, well-groomed coat that reflects the sunlight. The dog would be running and playing in the field, surrounded by colorful wildflowers, and would appear happy and carefree. The dog's fur would be slightly ruffled from the wind and the activity, and its tail would be wagging excitedly as it enjoys the outdoors.
