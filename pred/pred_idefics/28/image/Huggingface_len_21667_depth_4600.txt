A golden retriever with a glossy coat playing in a field of wildflowers on a warm afternoon would likely have a shiny, well-groomed coat that reflects the sunlight. The dog's fur would be slightly ruffled from the wind and the movement of the dog as it plays. The dog's tail would be wagging happily, and its ears would be flapping in the breeze. The dog would be surrounded by a variety of colorful wildflowers, and its fur would be slightly stained with pollen from the flowers. The dog would be in a state of joy and contentment, enjoying the freedom and beauty of the natural environment.
