A golden retriever with a glossy coat looks like a happy and energetic dog, running and playing in a field of wildflowers on a warm afternoon. The dog's fur is shiny and well-groomed, and it is surrounded by a variety of colorful flowers. The dog is likely to be panting and enjoying the fresh air and the freedom of being outside.
