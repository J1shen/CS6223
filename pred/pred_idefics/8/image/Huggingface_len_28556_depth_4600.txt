A golden retriever in a field of vibrant wildflowers on a warm afternoon is likely to be enjoying the sights and smells of the flowers. They might be sniffing around, exploring the area, and possibly even playing or running around in the field. The dog might also be basking in the warmth of the sun and enjoying the fresh air.
